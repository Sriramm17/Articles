Three Language Formula(TLF) - Hindi/English

The new draft National education policy emphasis on making English and Mother tongue compulsory till class 10 and also making Hindi compulsory in non-Hindi speaking states and vice versa which causes a serious threat of forcing Hindi into non-Hindi speaking states.

This erroneous effort was successfully vindicated in the past in TamilNadu and still other non-Hindi speaking states has the same stand, but forcing Hindi via TLF and in turn trying to remove English from the land seems too pragmatic.

The Language policy was started from 1950 but still it did not get shaped due to huge resentment among the non-Hindi speaking states.

1.English is a language which has immense scope as it has transformed itself from a language of colonialism to a global language of culture, science, technology and world politics.

2.Replacement of English with Hindi completely based on all languages are similar is erroneous because Indian languages are of an identity and cultural expression but English is considered to be a language of Empowerment and Mobility making it a link language.

3.The resentment towards a third language by TamilNadu and its stand on Anti-Hindi is justifiable because why on Earth should they accept a language instead they can learn a subject or a skill.

4.TLF is unconstitutional because it does not have any constitutional backup and also Supreme court has ruled against it, adding to this it also violates the fundamental right to freedom of Speech and expression.

5.TLF is not only irrational but impractical for implementation too.

The Macaulay Test states that simply asking people what language they prefer and act accordingly to the people will atleast strengthen the Government's stand and peoples belief on democracy.

The non-Hindi speaking states along with TamilNadu can develop a case where English is emphasized as a second language throughout the country.
