The Donald trump administration's continuous attack on India and its  foreign policy is causing a serious dent on the foundation of Indo-US relations. 

The US statement of Asia-pacific region to Indo-pacific after Modi's visit to USA on June 2017 affirms its stand and consideration of India as its strategic partner, also pentagon reorganized and named the US pacific command to Indo-pacific command which is a serious signal of close strategic partnership and geo political prominence.

But somehow the current actions of trump administration seems hostile and causing serious downgrade to the US-INDIA strategic partnership.

Firstly, US had imposed a ban on use of Iranian oil and withdrawn the exception granted to India on this regard after May 2019 showing American utilitarianism had trumped strategic thinking and it had torn off the "strategic autonomy" for Indian policy makers.

Secondly, the US threat to impose sanctions on India if the deal for purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia is not scarped citing this deal would violate the federal law of US puts India in a catch 22 position and a major negative implication on Indian relationship with Russia.

The third and latest being the removing India from the preferential trade program known as GSP for which Mr. Trump had signed a presidential decree which denies India preferential treatment for Indian goods exported to US to a tune of 6.35 billion USD citing Indian stand on not allowing preferential market for American goods exported to India.

These three decisions indicate that that America doesn't differentiate between Friend and foe anymore and severely diminishes its previous statement as India a valued strategic partner.
This attitude of America will affect its future relations with India and also Washington should think that even an indispensable nation require reliable friends and allies.
